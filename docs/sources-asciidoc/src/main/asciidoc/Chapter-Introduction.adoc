Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is the standard for describing data structures in telecommunication and computer networking world.
ASN.1 provides a set of formal rules for describing the structure of objects.
The specification describes abstract objects that are independent of machine-specific encoding techniques. 

ASN defined data can be encoded using one of these encoding rules: 

* Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
* Canonical Encoding Rules (CER)
* Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
* XML Encoding Rules (XER)
* Packed Encoding Rules (PER)
* Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER)

ASN.1, together with specific ASN.1 encoding rules, facilitates the exchange of structured data between application programs over networks by describing data structures in a way that is independent of machine architecture and implementation language. 

ASN encoded data looks logically as follows:

Encoded data structure contains three elements:

Tag::
  Unique value, which identifies the type of data. 

Length::
  Indicates the length of the current data structure. 

Payload::
  Depending on the definition, this can be a simple value (like an integer), or it can carry another ASN encoded data structure.
